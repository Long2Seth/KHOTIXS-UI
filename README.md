# ✨KHOTIXS

KHOTIXS, established in 2024 by Institute of Science and Technology Advanced Development students, is built on inclusivity, innovation, and user-centric design. By addressing the needs of both organizers and users, the platform bridges the gap between vision and execution, helping events become more accessible and impactful. The idea for KHOTIXS emerged from a deep understanding of the challenges event organizers and users face in today’s fast-paced, digital-first world. Despite the abundance of tools available, many platforms failed to provide a seamless and efficient experience for managing events and ticketing.
